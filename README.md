## Early Prediction of Cognitive Deficit using Deep Learning and Brain Connectome

This repository contains the code for CNN/DNN/VGG network introduced in the following papers:

[A multi-task, multi-stage deep transfer learning model for early prediction of neurodevelopment in very preterm infants](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-71914-x)

## Installation
Make sure you have [Python](https://www.python.org/) installed, then install [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/) on your system.

## Usage

### Prepare the training data



### Pre-trained VGG model

Please also download the pre-trained VGG model from [here](https://github.com/machrisaa/tensorflow-vgg).
